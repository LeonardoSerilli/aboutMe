# 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Computer Science professional** with a **Bachelor’s degree from L’Aquila University (Italy)** and a **Master’s degree with highest honors (110 e lode) from Côte d’Azur University (France)**, where I specialized in **Ubiquitous Networking**. My academic path included research in **Quantum Computing algorithms** and contributions to **network analysis projects** with the **INRIA COATI team**.

Professionally, I worked as a **developer at Amadeus (via Inetum)**, contributing to the company’s internal test infrastructure within a **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)** environment. These experiences strengthened my skills in **software engineering, scalable systems, and collaborative development practices**.

Currently, I am the **Founder of Daedalus Lab** (https://www.daedaluslab.it/), where we design and develop **sustainable, scalable, and modern software solutions** for clients worldwide.

In addition to professional and academic work, I actively participate in **Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions** and platforms such as **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**, further developing my expertise in **cybersecurity, problem-solving, and applied systems knowledge**.
